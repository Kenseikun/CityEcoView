                    We are based in Warsaw. The pilot run of our MVP will also take place in here. However, we are not
                    limiting our data collection only to Warsaw. We have number of dedicated volueters who provide us
                    with
                    regular data input from London, Tel Aviv and New York. We keep growing on unprecedented scale.
                    <br /><br />
                    <span>Why Warsaw?</span>
                    <br /><br />
                    Warsaw is a great place to find very skillful staff that are committed to what they do. It is a good
                    place for young business as well as local and foreign investors thanks to non-equity programs.
                    <br /><br />
                    Moreover, Warsaw is a young and vibrant city which leads trends in Poland. Recently, Warsaw has been
                    named as the sixth most vegan-friendly city in the world by the leading international guide for
                    vegan
                    restaurants. The top three cities in Happy Cow’s ranking are London, New York and Berlin.
                    <br /><br />
                    This shows that Warsaw is modern and tries to be ecological at least from the restaurants’ point of
                    view.
